            This project was probably the most difficult to complete. Between missing a team member then having to fill him in on what he missed and being so pressed for time, it was difficult to make a complete project. In the end, we ended up having to Google Hangout to finish working out the kinks in the project and merging it all together. Though we did import all of the styling from our previous project, the style elements were never actually implemented, so the webpage looks extremely basic as it is the default design. Despite all of the difficulties we were presented with, our team managed to create a bare minimum functional webpage that performed the tasks required of it, no more, no less.
