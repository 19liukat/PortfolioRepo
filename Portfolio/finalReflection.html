            Overall, the full stack summer camp was an incredible experience to learn in a fast-paced environment where nearly everyone had about the same level of knowledge of the content. Everyday we were pushed in a totally new direction that stretched our boundaries to the fullest extent. It would have been nice to have more instruction regarding source control. Although all of us had some experience from earlier in the year, it was very difficult to pick up again, especially at such a high level. Because so many of our projects were dependent upon correct source control, it was difficult to properly merge and finish our products. Besides that, the fast pace was just quick enough that every project was finished but not too quick that we were leaving projects in states of disarray.
