            The team project was definitely the most exciting assignment from the entire summer camp. It was extremely rewarding to see our efforts and learning culminate into a cohesive final project. It was fun to play around with styling with absolutely no boundaries as well as create a unique solution to the problem of navigation and searching. It was difficult to begin with because we all felt so lost with no solution to our problems, but on the second day, things just kept on coming together until we had one complete solution. We struggled most on the search bar and source control. The search bar was difficult simply because we had never coded something like that before. Though we had practiced source control through the three week camp, it felt as if we were just learning the process because the project was so much larger than all the other activities we had done previously. It was a great experience, but the best part of this project was definitely seeing how all the other teams decided to create their webpage and how they coded their pages so differently from ours.
