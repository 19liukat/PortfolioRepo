        <div class="reflection col-md-10">When we were given a time limit, we tended to cut some corners in terms of source control. Instead of going through the process of creating pull requests, we skipped ahead and merged our branches into dev by ourselves. However, with more pressure on us, we were able to communicate much quicker than we had in previous activities. Despite our faster pace and losing conventional source control, we still struggled to finish the activity in time. It took nearly half an hour more to finish the entire web page. Although we did not finish on time, we had many major successes. Obviously, the project was much more efficient in terms of communication and completion of the required code. We also had a quite complex background that we originally thought would be impossible to implement. Overall, this activity was a opportunity with a steep learning curve.</div>
