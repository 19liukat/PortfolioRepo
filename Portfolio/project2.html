        <div class="reflection col-md-10">During this activity, we learned the basics of source control through GitHub and GitKraken. At first, the source control system was a pretty easy concept to grasp, but as we advanced further into the activity, we faced more difficulties. All of my teammates and I had done source control in Java during the school year. However, one of the issues we had was using C# to code which became quite easy as we progressed. Another issue we had was dealing with merge conflicts. It took some time to work out, especially because Visual Code needed an integrated terminal in the launching file that gave us a lot of grief. By the end, the whole team was pretty well versed in the ins and outs of source control and coding in C#.</div>
